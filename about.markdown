## My Specialty
I specialize in designing and building custom automation testing frameworks that monitor hero, revenue-generating features for companies. My contributions have yielded tangible outcomes like actual money recouped for violated SLAs. I am often hired as a Software Engineer in Test, but can contribute to DevOps and frontend codebases. As a Cypress ambassador, lifelong learner and Quality Engineering specialist, I’m committed to building quality all the way through the SDLC and fostering a high  esteem workplace.

## What's Science Got to Do with It?
I once heard someone say, “science is the great equalizer.” When I began studying software engineering 7 years ago, after transitioning as a biology major and from within the sciences, I leaned on the scientific method to probe and engage with foreign topics, like Node.js debugging and cross-origin site errors. Computers have a science, after all.

It turns out, scientific thinking has deep roots in engineering. Many of the Lean tools I employ daily are abstractions of the scientific method. I have found that SRE and DevOps teams also adapt these principles. That may be why I find Quality and SRE teams to have a natural partnership. I enjoy applying these problem solving techniques as I build my work, skills and self in this field.

## More About this Space
I enjoy thinking and writing about engineering, specifically engineering sub-topics like testing. In the future, I may write about topics beyond engineering that I'm passionate about, like cooking.
