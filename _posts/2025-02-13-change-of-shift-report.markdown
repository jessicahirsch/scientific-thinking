## Adapted for Software Engineers

Rarely are software engineers working in the same room at the same time. Often, software engineering teams are distributed, working in different states, timezones, and even continents. When pairing on a project, different timezones becomes a silent contributor to the workflow. An engineer logging on in Belarus at 9am, is outpacing their pairing partner in San Francisco where it is 10pm the night before. There is an approximate 11 hour difference between their work days.
